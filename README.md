# Shoping_Site_Design
Demo Project.

A non-functional shopping site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is focused on front-end design, showcasing the layout and user interface (UI) of an online store. The site includes various sections, such as product listings, hero section, navigation bar, search bar and other essential components, without back-end functionality or real e-commerce features.
